# SQL Learning

This repository documents my structured SQL learning journey, organized day by day with a clear progression from fundamentals to advanced database concepts.

It includes:
- Core SQL queries and constraints
- Aggregations, joins, and subqueries
- Stored procedures and views
- Transaction control and indexing
- Practice query sets for hands-on learning

Each concept is supported with executable `.sql` files and detailed notes for clarity and revision.

This repository serves as a long-term reference for interview preparation and real-world database usage.
